# Open Source Contributions

I am a big fan of the open source philosophy and one of my biggest goals is to one day contribute to the Linux kernel. Here is a list of the projects I have contributed to.


## Pip

[pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip) is the most popular Python package manager. When working for my school's computer lab, I noticed that a very common installation pattern was often mistyped by students, leading to mass confusion. [My patch](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/9915) adds special logic for detecting this error and emits a helpful warning.
