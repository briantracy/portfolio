# Open Source Contributions

I am a big fan of the open source philosophy and one of my biggest goals is to one day contribute to the Linux kernel. Here is a list of the projects I have contributed to.


## Pip

[pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip) is the most popular Python package manager. When working for my school's computer lab, I noticed that a very common installation pattern was often mistyped by students, leading to mass confusion. [My patch](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/9915) adds special logic for detecting this error and emits a helpful warning.

## LLVM

[LLVM](https://llvm.org) is a compiler toolchain that is best known as the backend for the `clang` C/C++ compiler. One day at work I was looking through the `libc++` headers and found a typo, so I decided to fix it (and others) and send it to the LLVM contributors. [My final contribution](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/87a55137e2a2a6684a20223494ad46d2fa33aca8) was an assortment of spelling/grammar fixes in publicly facing aspects of LLVM.
